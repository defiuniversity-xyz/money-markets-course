## 📊 Multi-Protocol Portfolio Management

### Portfolio Structure

**Recommended Allocation** (Starting Point):

**By Protocol**:
- 40-50% Aave (foundation, safety)
- 20-30% Morpho (efficiency)
- 10-20% Euler (customization)
- 10-20% Alternative chains (optional)

**By Strategy**:
- 60-70% Supply only (low risk base)
- 20-30% Moderate leverage (optimization)
- 10-20% Aggressive strategies (max yield)

**By Asset**:
- 50-60% Stablecoins (base yield)
- 30-40% Blue-chip crypto (growth)
- 10-20% Yield-bearing tokens (optimization)

### Rebalancing Framework

**Triggers for Rebalancing**:
1. Significant rate spreads (>1% APY difference)
2. Risk threshold breaches
3. Utilization changes
4. Protocol updates/changes
5. Portfolio drift (>10% from target)

**Rebalancing Process**:
1. Assess current allocation
2. Identify opportunities
3. Calculate gas costs
4. Execute rebalancing
5. Update documentation

**Frequency**: Monthly review, quarterly rebalancing (unless major opportunities arise)

## 🔧 Automation Tools

### Health Factor Monitoring

**Setup Requirements**:
1. **Data Sources**: Protocol APIs, price feeds
2. **Alert Thresholds**: HF < 2.0 (warning), < 1.5 (critical)
3. **Notification Channels**: Email, Discord, Telegram, SMS
4. **Response Actions**: Auto-document, trigger alerts

**Tools**:
- Custom scripts (Python/JavaScript)
- DeFi portfolio trackers (Zapper, DeBank)
- Protocol-specific dashboards
- Webhook integrations

**Example Alert Configuration**:
```
Health Factor Alerts:
- Warning: HF < 2.0 (daily check)
- Critical: HF < 1.5 (immediate notification)
- Emergency: HF < 1.2 (SMS + all channels)

Price Alerts:
- Collateral: -10% in 24h
- Protocol: Pause/exploit announcements
```

### Automated Reporting

**Daily Report** (Automated):
- Current positions
- Health Factors
- Yields earned
- Notable changes

**Weekly Report**:
- Performance summary
- Risk assessment
- Opportunities identified
- Actions taken

**Monthly Report**:
- Comprehensive review
- Stress test results
- Rebalancing decisions
- Strategy adjustments

### Rebalancing Automation

**Conditions**:
- Rate spread > 1% APY for > 24 hours
- Risk score change > 20%
- Utilization shift > 10%

**Process** (Semi-Automated):
1. Detect condition
2. Calculate optimal rebalancing
3. Request approval (human-in-loop)
4. Execute if approved
5. Document action

**Safety**: Always require human approval for large moves.

## 📈 Performance Tracking

### Key Metrics

**1. Yield Metrics**:
- Gross APY (before costs)
- Net APY (after gas)
- Risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio)
- Comparison to benchmarks

**2. Risk Metrics**:
- Average Health Factor
- Maximum drawdown risk
- Liquidation probability
- Correlation exposure

**3. Cost Metrics**:
- Total gas spent
- Gas as % of yield
- Transaction frequency
- Cost per position

**4. Operational Metrics**:
- Time spent managing
- Alert frequency
- Rebalancing frequency
- System uptime

### Benchmarking

**Benchmarks to Track**:
1. **Risk-free rate**: USDC supply on Aave
2. **Market average**: DeFiLlama money market index
3. **Your target**: Based on risk tolerance
4. **Best-in-class**: Top performers (risk-adjusted)

**Tracking Dashboard**:
```
Current Performance:
- Your Net APY: 5.2%
- Risk-free: 4.0%
- Market avg: 4.5%
- Target: 5.0%
- Status: ✅ Exceeding target

Risk Metrics:
- Avg HF: 2.3
