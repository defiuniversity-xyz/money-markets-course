# Lesson 2: The Mathematics of Lending and Borrowing

## 🎯 Core Concept: Math is Your Protection

Understanding the mathematics behind money markets isn't just academic—it's your primary defense against losses. These formulas determine:
- How much you can borrow safely
- When your position becomes vulnerable to liquidation
- What interest rates you'll earn or pay
- Whether a position is profitable or dangerous

Master these calculations, and you'll make informed decisions, avoid costly mistakes, and optimize your returns.

## 📐 Loan-to-Value (LTV) and Liquidation Threshold (LT)

### The Fundamental Metrics

**Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: The maximum borrowing capacity as a percentage of collateral value.

**Liquidation Threshold (LT)**: The safety line—the collateral-to-debt ratio at which liquidation is triggered.

### Understanding the Difference

This distinction is critical and often misunderstood by beginners:

**LTV = Maximum Borrowing Capacity**
- If LTV = 80%, you can borrow up to $80 for every $100 of collateral
- This is NOT the liquidation point

**LT = Liquidation Trigger Point**
- If LT = 85%, liquidation occurs when your debt equals 85% of collateral value
- This is the actual danger line

**The Safety Buffer** = LT - LTV

### Example: ETH Collateral Position

**Initial Setup**:
- Collateral: $10,000 worth of ETH
- Maximum LTV: 80%
- Liquidation Threshold: 85%

**Maximum Borrowing**:
- Maximum borrow = $10,000 × 0.80 = **$8,000**

**Safety Buffer**:
- Buffer = $10,000 × (0.85 - 0.80) = **$500**
- This means you have a $500 cushion before liquidation

**What Happens as Price Moves**:
- If ETH drops to $9,500: Collateral value = $9,500, debt = $8,000
- Debt ratio = $8,000 ÷ $9,500 = 84.2% (still safe)
- If ETH drops to $9,411: Collateral value = $9,411, debt = $8,000
- Debt ratio = $8,000 ÷ $9,411 = **85% (LIQUIDATION TRIGGERED)**

### Why Two Different Numbers?

Protocols use two thresholds to:
1. **Prevent over-borrowing** (LTV limit)
2. **Provide liquidation buffer** (LT allows for price movement between checks)

The gap between LTV and LT gives liquidators time to act before the protocol becomes insolvent.

## 🔢 Health Factor: Your Safety Score

### The Health Factor Formula

The Health Factor (HF) is the single most important metric when borrowing:

$$Health Factor = \frac{Collateral Value \times Liquidation Threshold}{Total Debt}$$

### Interpreting Health Factor

**HF > 1.0**: Position is safe
- HF = 2.0: Can withstand ~50% collateral price drop
- HF = 1.5: Can withstand ~33% collateral price drop
- HF = 1.1: Danger zone—any small price movement risks liquidation

**HF ≤ 1.0**: Position is liquidatable
- HF = 1.0: Exactly at liquidation threshold
- HF < 1.0: Position is underwater (should have been liquidated)

### Strategic Health Factor Targets

**For Beginners**: HF > 2.0
- Provides substantial buffer against volatility
- Allows you to sleep at night
- Reduces stress and monitoring frequency

**For Active Traders**: HF = 1.5 - 2.0
- Higher capital efficiency
- Requires active monitoring
- Acceptable for experienced users

**Danger Zone**: HF < 1.3
- High liquidation risk
- Requires constant vigilance
- Not recommended for beginners

### Calculating Health Factor: Step-by-Step

**Scenario**: You deposit ETH and borrow USDC

**Initial Position**:
- Collateral: 5 ETH @ $2,000/ETH = $10,000
- Borrowed: $6,000 USDC
- Liquidation Threshold: 85%

**Health Factor Calculation**:
$$HF = \frac{\$10,000 \times 0.85}{\$6,000} = \frac{\$8,500}{\$6,000} = 1.42$$

**Interpretation**: HF = 1.42 means the collateral can drop ~30% before liquidation.

**What Happens if ETH Drops to $1,500?**
- New collateral value: 5 ETH × $1,500 = $7,500
- Debt remains: $6,000 (plus accrued interest)
- New HF = ($7,500 × 0.85) ÷ $6,000 = $6,375 ÷ $6,000 = **1.06**

**Status**: Still safe but approaching danger zone. You should consider adding collateral or repaying debt.

### Health Factor with Multiple Collaterals

When you have multiple collateral types, the formula aggregates:

$$HF = \frac{\sum(Collateral_i \times LT_i)}{Total Debt}$$

**Example**:
- Collateral 1: 3 ETH @ $2,000, LT = 85% → $5,100 effective
- Collateral 2: $4,000 USDC, LT = 90% → $3,600 effective
- Total Debt: $7,000 USDC

$$HF = \frac{\$5,100 + \$3,600}{\$7,000} = \frac{\$8,700}{\$7,000} = 1.24$$

## 💧 Utilization Rate and Interest Rate Curves

### What is Utilization Rate?

**Utilization Rate (U)** = The percentage of supplied assets currently borrowed:

$$U = \frac{Total Borrowed}{Total Supplied} \times 100\%$$

**Example**:
- Pool has 100 USDC supplied
- 60 USDC is borrowed
- Utilization = 60 ÷ 100 = **60%**

### Why Utilization Matters

Utilization directly drives interest rates through the interest rate model:
- **Low utilization** (< 50%): Lower rates (less demand, more supply)
- **Medium utilization** (50-80%): Moderate rates (balanced)
- **High utilization** (> 80%): Higher rates (high demand, low supply)
- **Very high utilization** (> 90%): Extremely high rates (liquidity crisis warning)

### The "Kinked" Interest Rate Model

Most protocols use a kinked curve with two distinct phases:

**Phase 1: Below the Kink** (e.g., U < 90%)
- Linear or gentle slope
- Supply rate: 2-5% APY
- Borrow rate: 5-8% APY
- Stable and predictable

**Phase 2: Above the Kink** (U > 90%)
- Exponential spike
- Supply rate: 10-50%+ APY
- Borrow rate: 50-200%+ APY
- Designed to incentivize repayments

### Example: Interest Rate Curve

**Below Kink (U = 70%)**:
- Supply rate: 4% APY
- Borrow rate: 6% APY
- Spread: 2% (to protocol reserves)

**At Kink (U = 90%)**:
- Supply rate: 5% APY
- Borrow rate: 8% APY
- Spread increases

**Above Kink (U = 95%)**:
- Supply rate: 15% APY
- Borrow rate: 50% APY
- Massive spread to attract liquidity

### The Liquidity Freeze Risk

**Critical Risk**: If utilization reaches 100%, lenders **cannot withdraw** until borrowers repay.

**Example Scenario**:
- Pool has $1M USDC supplied
- $1M USDC borrowed
- Utilization = 100%
- You try to withdraw $10,000
- **Result**: Transaction fails—no liquidity available

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Interest rate spikes incentivize repayments
- High rates attract new deposits
- Reserve funds (if protocol has them)
- Utilization caps (max borrowing limits)

## 📊 Interest Rate Calculations

### How Supply Rates Work

When you lend assets, you earn interest based on:
1. Utilization rate (how much is borrowed)
2. Borrow rate (what borrowers pay)
3. Reserve factor (protocol's cut)

**Simplified Formula**:
$$Supply Rate = Borrow Rate \times Utilization \times (1 - Reserve Factor)$$

**Example**:
- Borrow rate: 8% APY
- Utilization: 75%
- Reserve factor: 10% (protocol keeps 10%)

$$Supply Rate = 8\% \times 0.75 \times 0.90 = 5.4\% APY$$

### How Borrow Rates Work

Borrow rates are determined by the interest rate model based on utilization:

**Linear Model** (simplified):
$$Borrow Rate = Base Rate + (Utilization \times Slope)$$

**Kinked Model** (most common):
- Below kink: Lower slope
- Above kink: Steeper slope (exponential)

### Accrued Interest Calculation

Interest accrues continuously, not daily or monthly.

**For Lenders**:
- Your balance grows automatically
- aToken balance increases over time
- Compound effect: You earn interest on interest

**For Borrowers**:
- Your debt increases over time
- Interest compounds
- Must repay principal + accrued interest

**Example: Borrowing $10,000 at 6% APY**:
- After 1 month: Debt = $10,000 × (1 + 0.06/12) = $10,050
- After 6 months: Debt = $10,000 × (1 + 0.06/2) = $10,300
- After 1 year: Debt = $10,000 × 1.06 = $10,600

![Interest Rate Curve (Kinked Model)](https://storage.googleapis.com/money-markets-gitbook-images/lessons/lesson_02/mm02_02_interest_rate_curve_kinked_model.png)

**Key Insight**: If you don't monitor your position, the debt grows even if collateral price stays the same.

## 🔮 The Role of Oracles

### What Are Oracles?

Oracles are bridges between off-chain price data and on-chain smart contracts. They feed real-world price information (like ETH/USD) to the protocol.

### Oracle Types

**1. Chainlink (Push-Based)**
- Updates pushed to chain regularly
- Industry standard for Ethereum
- Highly secure and reliable
- Updates every few hours or minutes

**2. Pyth Network (Pull-Based)**
- Updates on-demand when needed
- Used for high-frequency chains (Solana, Sui)
- Lower latency for fast transactions
- More efficient for high-throughput networks

**3. Redstone (On-Demand)**
- Pull-based oracle
- Used by some protocols for flexibility
- Can provide custom data feeds

### Oracle Risk

**The Risk**: If an oracle provides incorrect price data, the protocol makes decisions based on wrong information.

**Attack Vector**: Oracle manipulation via flash loans
- Attacker takes large flash loan
- Manipulates price on low-liquidity DEX
- Oracle reads manipulated price
- Protocol liquidates positions incorrectly
- Attacker profits from liquidations

**Protection Mechanisms**:
- Multiple oracle sources (e.g., Chainlink + Uniswap TWAP)
- Price staleness checks (reject old prices)
- Confidence intervals (require price consensus)
- Circuit breakers (pause if price moves too fast)

### Why Oracle Choice Matters

Different protocols use different oracles, which affects risk:

**Chainlink**: Most secure, but updates may lag during volatility
**Pyth**: Fast updates, good for high-frequency chains
**TWAP**: Smooths out manipulation but may lag behind market

**For Beginners**: Prefer protocols using established oracles (Chainlink) with multiple data sources.

## 🧮 Complete Calculation Example

Let's work through a complete example:

**Initial Position Setup**:
- You deposit: 10 ETH @ $2,000/ETH = $20,000 collateral
- Protocol parameters:
  - LTV: 75%
  - Liquidation Threshold: 80%
  - Interest: 5% APY borrow rate

**Step 1: Calculate Maximum Borrow**
- Max borrow = $20,000 × 0.75 = **$15,000**

**Step 2: Decide Borrowing Amount**
- You borrow: $10,000 USDC (conservative, 50% of max)

**Step 3: Calculate Initial Health Factor**
$$HF = \frac{\$20,000 \times 0.80}{\$10,000} = \frac{\$16,000}{\$10,000} = 1.60$$

**Step 4: After 6 Months**

**Scenario A: ETH Price Stable**
- Collateral: Still 10 ETH @ $2,000 = $20,000
- Debt: $10,000 × (1 + 0.05/2) = $10,250
- New HF = ($20,000 × 0.80) ÷ $10,250 = **1.56**

**Scenario B: ETH Rises 25%**
- Collateral: 10 ETH @ $2,500 = $25,000
- Debt: $10,250
- New HF = ($25,000 × 0.80) ÷ $10,250 = **1.95** ✅ Safer

**Scenario C: ETH Drops 30%**
- Collateral: 10 ETH @ $1,400 = $14,000
- Debt: $10,250
- New HF = ($14,000 × 0.80) ÷ $10,250 = **1.09** ⚠️ Danger zone

**Analysis**:
- Scenario A: Position safe, slight HF decline from interest
- Scenario B: Position safer, can borrow more or enjoy buffer
- Scenario C: Must take action—add collateral or repay debt

## 🎓 Beginner's Corner: Common Math Mistakes

**Mistake 1**: Confusing LTV with liquidation threshold
- **Wrong**: "LTV is 80%, so I'll get liquidated at 80%"
- **Right**: Liquidation occurs at the LT (often 85%), not LTV

**Mistake 2**: Ignoring accrued interest
- **Wrong**: "My debt stays the same"
- **Right**: Debt grows continuously. A 5% APY borrow rate means ~0.42% monthly increase

**Mistake 3**: Not accounting for price volatility
- **Wrong**: "ETH won't drop 50%"
- **Right**: Crypto is volatile. A 50% drop in a day is possible. Calculate HF at worst-case scenarios

**Mistake 4**: Misunderstanding utilization
- **Wrong**: "High utilization means I earn more" (true but risky)
- **Right**: High utilization means higher rates but also higher risk of liquidity freezes

**Mistake 5**: Not monitoring Health Factor
- **Wrong**: "I'll check it monthly"
- **Right**: Monitor daily or use alerts. Prices can move fast, and interest accrues continuously.

## 🔬 Advanced Deep-Dive: Dynamic Interest Rates

### Adaptive Interest Rate Models

Some protocols (like Morpho) use adaptive curves that adjust automatically:

**Target Utilization**: The protocol targets a specific utilization (e.g., 90%)

**Mechanism**:
- If utilization > target: Curve shifts up, rates increase
- If utilization < target: Curve shifts down, rates decrease
- This maintains consistent utilization levels

**Formula** (simplified):
$$Borrow Rate = Base + (Utilization - Target) \times Sensitivity$$

**Result**: Markets maintain high utilization (efficient capital use) while keeping rates reasonable.

### Compounding Frequency

Interest can compound at different frequencies:

**Continuous Compounding** (most DeFi):
- Interest accrues every block
- Formula: $A = P \times e^{rt}$
- Most accurate representation

**Block-by-Block**:
- Interest calculated per block
- Updates continuously
- Standard for on-chain protocols

**Daily Compounding**:
- Interest calculated daily
- Less accurate but simpler
- Rare in modern DeFi

## 📈 Real-World Calculation: Aave USDC Market

**Market State**:
- Total Supplied: $500,000,000 USDC
- Total Borrowed: $350,000,000 USDC
- Utilization: 70%

**Interest Rates** (at 70% utilization):
- Supply APY: 4.5%
- Borrow APY: 6.5%
- Spread: 2% (to Aave reserves)

**Your Position**:
- You supply: $10,000 USDC
- Daily earnings: $10,000 × 0.045 ÷ 365 = **$1.23/day**
- Monthly earnings: $1.23 × 30 = **$37/month**
- Annual earnings: **$450/year**

**If Utilization Spikes to 95%**:
- Supply APY: 12% (estimated)
- Borrow APY: 45% (estimated)
- Your new daily earnings: $10,000 × 0.12 ÷ 365 = **$3.29/day**

**Trade-off**: Higher yields but increased risk of liquidity freeze if utilization hits 100%.
