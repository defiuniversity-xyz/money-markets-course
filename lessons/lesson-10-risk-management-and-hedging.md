# Lesson 10: Risk Management and Hedging

## 🎯 Core Concept: Professional Risk Management

Advanced risk management goes beyond monitoring Health Factor. This lesson teaches portfolio diversification, liquidation protection systems, hedging strategies, and building comprehensive risk frameworks for multi-protocol operations.

## 📊 Portfolio Diversification

### Multi-Protocol Strategy

**Why Diversify**:
- Protocol-specific risks (bugs, governance attacks)
- Liquidity fragmentation
- Rate volatility differences
- Insurance coverage variations

**Diversification Framework**:

**By Protocol**:
- 40-50% Aave (safety, insurance)
- 20-30% Morpho (efficiency)
- 10-20% Euler (customization)
- 10-20% Alternative chains (yield)

**By Asset**:
- Stablecoins: 50-60% (base yield)
- Blue-chip crypto: 30-40% (growth + yield)
- Yield-bearing tokens: 10-20% (optimization)

**By Strategy**:
- Supply only: 60-70% (low risk)
- Moderate leverage: 20-30% (optimization)
- Aggressive strategies: 10-20% (maximum yield)

### Correlation Analysis

**Understanding Correlation**:
- Assets that move together amplify risk
- Diversification reduces impact of single asset failure

**Example Portfolio**:
- USDC (stable)
- ETH (volatile, uncorrelated with stablecoins)
- BTC (volatile, correlated with ETH but different magnitude)
- LSTs (correlated with ETH but with staking yield)

**Risk**: If crypto crashes together, crypto-collateralized positions all at risk.

## 🛡️ Liquidation Protection Strategies

### Health Factor Monitoring Systems

**Automated Alerts**:
1. Set HF threshold alerts (e.g., alert if HF < 1.8)
2. Price movement alerts for collateral
3. Utilization spike alerts (affects rates)
4. Protocol pause/incident alerts

**Tools**:
- DeFi portfolio trackers (Zapper, DeBank)
- Custom scripts (webhooks + Discord/Telegram)
- Protocol-specific dashboards
- Price alert services (CoinGecko, etc.)

### Dynamic Collateral Management

**Strategy 1**: Maintain Reserve Fund
- Keep 20-30% of capital in stablecoins outside positions
- Use to add collateral if HF drops
- Provides buffer during volatility

**Strategy 2**: Multiple Collateral Types
- Don't rely on single collateral
- Diversify across asset classes
- If one crashes, others may hold

**Strategy 3**: Conservative LTV
- Borrow only 40-50% of max LTV
- Maintain larger safety buffer
- Reduces need for constant monitoring

### Automated Protection Mechanisms

**1. Keep3r/Chainlink Automation**:
- Automatically add collateral if HF drops
- Requires gas funds in reserve
- Set threshold triggers

**2. Protocol-Specific Features**:
- Aave: Safety module insurance
- Kamino: Auto-Deleverage
- Some protocols: Partial liquidation protection

**3. Smart Contract Safeguards**:
- Set max borrow limits
- Automatic position reduction at thresholds
- Flash loan protection

## 🔄 Hedging Strategies

### Understanding Hedging

**Definition**: Taking offsetting positions to reduce risk

**Goal**: Limit downside while maintaining upside potential

### Common Hedging Techniques

**1. Stablecoin Hedging**
- Borrow against volatile collateral
- Hold borrowed stablecoins as hedge
- If collateral crashes, stablecoins preserve value

**Example**:
- Collateral: 10 ETH @ $2,000 = $20,000
- Borrow: $10,000 USDC (hold as reserve)
- If ETH drops 50%: Collateral = $10,000, debt = $10,000
- Net position: $0 loss (instead of -$10,000)

**2. Options Hedging** (Advanced)
- Buy put options on collateral
- Limits downside exposure
- Cost: Premium payments

**3. Futures Hedging**
- Short futures against collateral
- Offsets price movements
- Requires active management

### Partial Hedging

**Strategy**: Hedge portion of position

**Example**:
- Position: $20,000 ETH collateral, $10,000 debt
- Hedge: Short $5,000 ETH futures
- Result: 50% hedged, 50% exposed

**Balance**: Maintains upside potential while limiting downside.

## 🏗️ Risk Management Framework

### Risk Assessment Matrix

**Evaluate Each Position**:

| Factor | Score (1-5) | Weight | Weighted Score |
|--------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| Protocol Risk | ___ | 30% | ___ |
| Collateral Volatility | ___ | 25% | ___ |
| Health Factor | ___ | 20% | ___ |
| Liquidity Risk | ___ | 15% | ___ |
| Oracle Risk | ___ | 10% | ___ |
| **Total Risk Score** | | | **___** |

**Risk Thresholds**:
- < 2.0: Low risk (acceptable)
- 2.0-3.0: Moderate risk (monitor closely)
- > 3.0: High risk (reduce or exit)

### Position Sizing Framework

**Kelly Criterion** (Simplified):
$$Position Size = \frac{Edge}{Odds}$$

**For Money Markets**:
- Edge = Expected yield advantage
- Odds = Risk of loss

**Conservative Approach**: Use fractional Kelly (50% of calculated size)

**Example**:
- Expected edge: 2% APY advantage
- Risk of loss: 5% (liquidation + protocol risk)
- Position size: (0.02 / 0.05) × 0.5 = 20% of capital

### Stress Testing

**Scenario Analysis**:
1. **Base Case**: Expected outcomes
2. **Stress Case**: 30% collateral drop
3. **Extreme Case**: 50% drop + protocol pause

**For Each Scenario**:
- Calculate new Health Factor
- Assess liquidity availability
- Evaluate exit options
- Calculate potential losses

**Action Plan**: Define responses for each scenario before they occur.

## 🚨 Emergency Exit Procedures

### When to Exit

**Triggers**:
- HF < 1.2 (critical)
- Protocol pause/exploit announced
- Oracle failure detected
- Critical collateral depeg
- Major market crash (>30% in 24h)

### Exit Execution

**Option 1**: Repay Debt
1. Calculate total debt (principal + interest)
2. Ensure funds available (reserve fund)
3. Repay via protocol interface
4. Withdraw collateral
5. Time: Minutes (depends on network)

**Option 2**: Add Collateral
1. Calculate required collateral
2. Transfer additional assets
3. Deposit to increase HF
4. Time: Fastest option if reserves available

**Option 3**: Partial Exit
1. Repay portion of debt
2. Withdraw some collateral
3. Maintain smaller position
4. Time: Intermediate strategy

### Exit Timing

**Consider**:
- Gas costs vs position value
- Network congestion (delays during volatility)
- Price slippage if swapping
- Time to execute full exit

**Preparation**: Keep gas tokens ready, have exit plan documented.

## 📈 Risk-Adjusted Returns

### Sharpe Ratio (Simplified)

**Formula**:
$$Sharpe = \frac{Return - Risk Free Rate}{Volatility}$$

**For Money Markets**:
- Return = Net APY earned
- Risk-free rate = Stable supply rate (e.g., 4%)
- Volatility = Standard deviation of returns

**Interpretation**:
- > 1.0: Good risk-adjusted returns
- 1.0-2.0: Very good
- > 2.0: Excellent

### Sortino Ratio

**Focus**: Downside volatility only (more relevant for lending)

**Formula**:
$$Sortino = \frac{Return - Risk Free Rate}{Downside Deviation}$$

**Benefit**: Doesn't penalize positive volatility (upside gains).

## 🎯 Risk Management Best Practices

### Daily Practices

1. Check Health Factors on all positions
2. Review collateral prices (any significant moves?)
3. Monitor protocol news/updates
4. Check utilization rates (affects yields)
5. Review any alerts/notifications

### Weekly Practices

1. Calculate risk scores for all positions
2. Review portfolio allocation
3. Assess any new opportunities
4. Update exit plans if needed
5. Review performance vs targets

### Monthly Practices

1. Comprehensive portfolio review
2. Stress test all positions
3. Rebalance if needed
4. Update risk framework
5. Document lessons learned

## 🎓 Beginner's Corner

**Q: How much should I hedge?**
A: Start with 0% hedging. As you scale, consider 20-30% partial hedging on large positions.

**Q: What's the minimum HF to maintain?**
A: 2.0 absolute minimum. Consider 2.5+ for peace of mind.

**Q: Should I diversify across many protocols?**
A: Start with 2-3 reputable protocols. Too many = harder to monitor.

**Q: How often should I check positions?**
A: Daily during active positions. Weekly if supply-only conservative strategies.

## 🔬 Advanced Deep-Dive: Correlation Hedging

### Portfolio Correlation Matrix

**Calculate correlations**:
- ETH vs BTC: High (0.7-0.9)
- ETH vs Stablecoins: Low (0.1-0.3)
- BTC vs Stablecoins: Low (0.1-0.3)

**Hedging Strategy**:
- If holding ETH collateral, diversify with stablecoin positions
- Avoid over-concentration in correlated assets
- Use uncorrelated assets to reduce portfolio risk

## 📊 Real-World Example: Risk Management

**Portfolio**:
- $50k total capital

**Allocation**:
- $25k Aave: USDC supply (HF: N/A, risk: low)
- $15k Morpho: ETH collateral, $7.5k USDC borrowed (HF: 2.5, risk: moderate)
- $10k reserve: USDC (emergency fund)

**Risk Assessment**:
- Protocol risk: Diversified (low)
- Collateral risk: ETH only (moderate)
- Health Factor: 2.5 (safe)
- Liquidity: Reserve fund available (low risk)

**Action Plan**:
- Daily: Check Morpho HF
- If HF < 2.0: Add collateral from reserve
- If HF < 1.5: Repay $2.5k debt
- If protocol issues: Exit immediately
