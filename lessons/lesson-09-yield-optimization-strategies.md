# Lesson 9: Yield Optimization Strategies

## 🎯 Core Concept: Maximizing Returns While Managing Risk

Yield optimization in money markets requires balancing multiple factors: supply rates, borrow costs, leverage, gas fees, and risk. This lesson teaches you to calculate true yields, execute looping strategies safely, and identify cross-protocol arbitrage opportunities.

## 📊 Supply Rate Maximization

### Understanding True Yield

**Components of Yield**:
- Base supply APY
- Protocol rewards (if applicable)
- Compounding frequency
- Gas costs (relative to position size)

**True Yield Formula**:
$$True Yield = Base APY + Rewards - \frac{Gas Costs \times Transactions}{Principal \times Time}$$

**Example**:
- Base APY: 5%
- Gas per transaction: $0.50 (on L2)
- Transactions per year: 12 (monthly compounding)
- Principal: $10,000
- True yield: 5% - ($0.50 × 12) / $10,000 = 4.94%

### Supply Rate Factors

**1. Utilization Rate**
- Higher utilization = higher supply rates
- Monitor utilization trends
- Move funds to higher-utilization pools when appropriate

**2. Network Selection**
- L2s (Arbitrum/Base): Lower gas, lower yields
- Mainnet: Higher gas, potentially higher yields
- Calculate break-even point based on position size

**3. Stablecoin vs Crypto**
- Stablecoins: Lower yields, lower risk
- Crypto: Higher yields (if used as collateral), higher risk
- Balance based on risk tolerance

## 💰 Borrow Rate Optimization

### When Borrowing Makes Sense

**1. Leverage Strategies**
- Amplify yields on yield-bearing assets
- Example: Stake ETH (5% APY), borrow against it (4% cost) = 1% net + leverage

**2. Arbitrage Opportunities**
- Borrow low, lend high (different protocols)
- Example: Borrow USDC at 4% on Aave, lend at 6% on Morpho = 2% spread

**3. Tax Efficiency**
- Borrow against assets instead of selling
- Avoid taxable events
- Interest may be tax-deductible (consult tax professional)

### Calculating Borrow Profitability

**Net Yield Formula**:
$$Net Yield = (Asset Yield \times Leverage) - (Borrow Rate \times (Leverage - 1))$$

**Example**:
- Asset yield: 7% (JitoSOL staking)
- Leverage: 3x
- Borrow rate: 5%
- Net yield: (7% × 3) - (5% × 2) = 11% APY

**Break-Even Point**:
$$Break-Even = \frac{Borrow Rate \times (Leverage - 1)}{Leverage}$$

If borrow rate exceeds this, position becomes unprofitable.

## 🔄 Looping Strategies

### What is Looping?

**Definition**: Borrowing against collateral to buy more of the same asset, repeating the process to amplify exposure.

**Steps**:
1. Deposit asset as collateral
2. Borrow stablecoins
3. Buy more of the asset
4. Deposit as collateral
5. Repeat

### Manual Looping (Step-by-Step)

**Example**: Loop ETH position

**Initial**: 10 ETH @ $2,000 = $20,000

**Iteration 1**:
- Deposit 10 ETH (LTV 75%, max borrow $15,000)
- Borrow $10,000 USDC (conservative 50% of max)
- Buy 5 ETH with $10,000
- Total: 15 ETH collateral, $10,000 debt

**Iteration 2**:
- Deposit 5 new ETH (total 15 ETH)
- Borrow $5,000 USDC
- Buy 2.5 ETH
- Total: 17.5 ETH collateral, $15,000 debt

**Result**: 17.5 ETH exposure from initial 10 ETH (~1.75x leverage)

### Automated Looping (Kamino Multiply)

**Advantage**: Atomic transactions—all steps in one block

**How It Works**:
- Protocol handles all steps automatically
- Flash loans eliminate intermediate capital needs
- Single transaction = lower gas + lower slippage risk

**Example**: JitoSOL Multiply
- Deposit 10 JitoSOL
- Set 3x leverage
- Protocol automatically loops
- Receive 3x exposure in single transaction

### Loop Risk Management

**Critical Rules**:
1. **Monitor Health Factor**: Keep HF > 2.0 minimum
2. **Calculate Break-Even**: Know when position becomes unprofitable
3. **Set Stop-Loss**: Define exit strategy before entering
4. **Start Small**: Test with small positions first
5. **Understand Liquidation**: Know exact liquidation price

**Liquidation Price Formula**:
$$Liquidation Price = \frac{Debt}{Collateral \times LT}$$

Monitor constantly—loops amplify liquidation risk.

## 🌐 Cross-Protocol Arbitrage

### Identifying Opportunities

**Opportunities Arise When**:
- Utilization differences across protocols
- Interest rate spreads
- Reward programs
- Temporary market inefficiencies

**Example Scenario**:
- Aave USDC supply: 4% APY
- Morpho USDC vault: 5.5% APY
- Spread: 1.5% APY

**Strategy**: Move funds from Aave to Morpho to capture spread.

### Execution Considerations

**1. Gas Costs**
- Calculate if spread covers gas
- L2s reduce gas burden
- Minimum viable position size

**2. Withdrawal Limits**
- Check if immediate withdrawal possible
- Monitor idle liquidity on target protocol
- Have backup plan if withdrawal delayed

**3. Risk Differences**
- Understand protocol risk profiles
- Assess if extra yield compensates extra risk
- Consider insurance coverage differences

## 📈 Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Compound Frequency Optimization

**Understanding Compounding**:
- More frequent compounding = higher effective yield
- But requires more transactions = more gas

**Optimal Frequency**:
- Small positions: Quarterly or annually
- Large positions ($50k+): Monthly or weekly
- Very large positions: Daily (if gas justified)

**Formula**:
$$Effective APY = (1 + \frac{APY}{n})^n - 1$$

Where n = compounding frequency per year.

### Multi-Protocol Diversification

**Strategy**: Split capital across multiple protocols

**Benefits**:
- Diversify protocol risk
- Capture best rates per protocol
- Avoid single point of failure

**Example Allocation**:
- 40% Aave (safety, insurance)
- 30% Morpho (efficiency)
- 20% Euler (customization)
- 10% Kamino (leverage strategies)

### Yield Aggregators

**What They Are**: Protocols that automatically optimize across money markets

**Examples**: Yearn, Beefy, Convex

**Pros**:
- Automated optimization
- Gas-efficient rebalancing
- Professional management

**Cons**:
- Additional smart contract risk
- Fees (performance + management)
- Less control over strategy

- Protocol fees
- Opportunity costs

### Step 3: Identify Opportunities

### Step 4: Execute Safely

- Start small to test
- Monitor positions closely
- Have exit strategy
- Keep reserves for emergencies

### Step 5: Optimize Continuously

## ⚠️ Common Optimization Mistakes

**Mistake 1**: Chasing highest yield without considering risk
- **Fix**: Always assess risk-adjusted returns

**Mistake 2**: Ignoring gas costs
- **Fix**: Calculate true yield after fees

**Mistake 3**: Over-leveraging
- **Fix**: Keep HF > 2.0, understand liquidation risk

**Mistake 4**: Not monitoring positions
- **Fix**: Set up alerts, check daily

**Mistake 5**: Ignoring protocol differences
- **Fix**: Understand risk profiles, don't assume all protocols equal

## 📊 Real-World Optimization Example

**Scenario**: $50,000 to optimize

**Option A**: Aave only
- Supply USDC: 5% APY
- Annual earnings: $2,500

**Option B**: Diversified
- $20k Aave: 5% = $1,000
- $20k Morpho: 5.5% = $1,100
- $10k Kamino (2x leverage JitoSOL): 11% net = $1,100
- Total: $3,200
- **Extra yield**: $700 (28% improvement)

**Risk**: Higher (leverage + protocol diversification)
